# Minesweeper

This is a project I made which uses a Flood Fill Algorithm to re-create the game Minesweeper.
The main idea of this project was to try and work with the Flood Fill Algorithm.

## Things I learned

the different things you are able to do with a Flood Fill Algorithm. 
e.g the fill tool in a program like PhotoShop or Minesweeper's clear adjecent squares when clicking on a empty square.
